										<h2>Invasive pests threaten ecosystems and economies</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Invasive pests can have devastating effects on ecosystems and economies when introduced to environments where their populations are not naturally regulated. These pests can quickly spread and outcompete native species, disrupting the delicate balance of an ecosystem and causing significant harm to the environment. For example, invasive insects and diseases can wipe out entire forests, destroying habitats for wildlife and reducing the amount of carbon stored in the trees. Invasive pests can also decimate crops, leading to food shortages and economic losses for farmers and communities. The impacts of invasive pests can be far-reaching and long-lasting, as they can alter the structure and function of ecosystems, threatening the survival of native species and negatively affecting the livelihoods of local communities. It is important to understand the potential dangers posed by invasive pests and take measures to prevent their introduction and spread in order to protect the environment and maintain a healthy, balanced ecosystem.</p>

												<h3>Sentinel gardens monitor invasive pests</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A pest sentinel garden is a type of sentinel garden designed to monitor the presence and spread of pests in an ecosystem. Their efficacy, or effectiveness, depends on proper data management. This means that the data collected from the garden must be accurately recorded, stored, and analyzed in order to be useful in tracking and understanding pest populations and their impact on the environment. Effective data management ensures that the information gathered from the garden is accurate and up-to-date, allowing scientists and researchers to make informed decisions about pest control and management strategies.</p>

												<h3>Data management on a global scale is complex</h3>
											</header>
										    <p>Data collection plays a crucial role in detecting invasive species through sentinel gardens, yet it is often overlooked in the literature. Sentinel garden data presents unique challenges, requiring accurate recording of each case of insect or pathogen colonization on non-native plants, including both the insect and the damage it causes, as well as real-time tree health data. The data must be accurate, easily collected and shared, and secure. The widespread availability of mobile phones adn internet access has made data collection more efficient, however sharing the data, analytics, and conclusions on global scale can still be difficult without standardization. </p>

												<h3>Aim</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In this study the aim was to develop a data collection, validation, and storage framework. We set about this with the following objectives:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Create a layout whereby data can easily be collected with minimal errors.</li>
												<li>Store data in a general and easily understandable format.</li>
												<li>Create a pipeline through which samples can easily be verified and validated.</li>
												<li>This platform must be useable in both China and the United States.</li>
											</ul>
