										<h2>Benefits of the project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The main challenges with regulating environmental pests such as wood borers is the large universe of unstudied offshore species: most of them are harmless while a few cause megadisturbances. A further problem is that current pest risk assessment personnel in the US relies on outdated or unreliable literature and data management techniques. <br/><br/>
										Sentinel gardens do not estimate impact – they show it. For example, before the invasion of the redbay ambrosia beetle, nobody would have predicted that it would be such a threat to redbay and avocado. Sentinel gardens supply direct data on impact of the woodborers on the trees. Such direct evidence alleviates many assumptions that risk analysts have to make. 
										In addition, sentinel gardens allow direct testing of pheromone lures to determine the US ability to detect the new threats. The lures are being used by the USDA Forest Service’s program Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR), and by the USDA Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey.<br/><br/>
										This is the only project known to us that directly documents the impact of offshore woodborers on important American forest tree species. The new information will be available for many other agency uses, for example, the National Plant Pest Organization (NAPPO) Pest Alerts. APHIS uses published information on potential invasive borers in for their risk assessment using the Objective Prioritization for Exotic Pests (OPEP) model and for the prioritization of species for the CAPS target list. The USDA Forest Service uses new pest information for their EDRR target species list.

												<h3>International benefits</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The deployment of sentinel gardens is emerging as an efficient approach to the risk assessment of exotic herbivores. A European Union team, led by INRA in Montpellier, France, has established a network of sentinel gardens in China a decade ago. These have produced more than 105 discoveries of potential pests new to Europe (reviewed in Kenis et al. 2018). The results led to the strengthening of relationships between the researchers and institutions in EU and China. In November 2019, the parties have signed an agreement to expand the collaboration and establish a formal intergovernmental laboratory. <br/><br/>
												While the Europe-China collaboration is ahead of any similar American effort, we will close the research gap, and also implement several innovations (namely the stressed-tree treatment, and the ability to source larger trees through connections to the nursery trade).

												<h3>Benefits to trade</h3>
											</header>
										    <p>Pre-invasion screening of overseas pests is not a barrier to trade. To the contrary: knowing which pests are harmful and which are harmless facilitates international trade. It is because the approach demonstrates which offshore woodborers are low priority. The Chinese counterparts are also fully supportive of the project, as evidenced by co-authored publications (e.g., Gao et al., 2017). </p>

												<h3>Objectives</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In this study the aim was to develop a data collection, validation, and storage framework. We set about this with the following objectives:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Establish and maintain sentinel gardens of American trees in several natural localities in China, spanning the tropical, subtropical and temperate regions that match the USA latitudinal range.</li>
												<li>Establish and maintain a reciprocal garden of Chinese trees in Florida.			</li>
												<li>Over 4 years, trees will be monitored for damage by wood borers attracted to living, healthy, and stressed trees.												</li>
												<li>For the high priority species, key risk factors are collected.												</li>
												<li>Establish a data management framework with the aim of securely and easily capturing, storing and sharing data in real time.												</li>
											</ul>
